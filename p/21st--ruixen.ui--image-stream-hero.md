     Two rails of images ride out of the vanishing point at the centre and sweep to both edges, growing and turning as they approach. Perspective does the sweep and the growth at once, and the loop never stops. -->

You are given a task to integrate an existing React component in the codebase

The codebase should support:
- shadcn project structure
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript

If it doesn't, provide instructions on how to setup project via shadcn CLI, install Tailwind or Typescript.

Determine the default path for components and styles.
If default path for components is not /components/ui, provide instructions on why it's important to create this folder
Copy-paste this component to /components/ui folder:
```tsx
components/ui/image-stream-hero.tsx
"use client";

import * as React from "react";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

/* ── the corridor ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two rails of cards ride from far behind the screen toward the
 * viewer. Perspective alone does the work that looks like two
 * animations: as a card's z grows it gets bigger *and* its screen x
 * sweeps outward from the vanishing point, because the projection
 * scales position and size by the same factor.
 *
 * Three things shape it, and each one fixes a specific artefact:
 *
 * 1. Depth is authored as *apparent size*, geometrically — each card
 *    is a constant ratio bigger than the one behind it, all the way
 *    out. Spacing a straight z-range evenly instead makes the near
 *    cards tear apart from each other as the projection blows up.
 * 2. The rails open hard in the first stretch and then hold
 *    (`fan` > 1). That opening cancels the — still slow — growth back
 *    there, so the ribbon leaves the centre as a flat band, bends
 *    once, and only then runs out on the diagonal. Parallel rails
 *    project to a straight cone with no bend at all.
 * 3. Neither end of the loop is ever on screen. A card dies with its
 *    inner edge past 50cqw, clear of the container's edge. And it is
 *    born *across* the axis — `railBirth` is negative, so the newest
 *    card starts on the far side and sweeps back through the centre.
 *    That plugs the throat: the axis stays covered at every instant,
 *    and a newborn lands behind cards that already cover it, so it
 *    needs no fade in. Birthing on its own side instead leaves a hole
 *    at dead centre that blinks open once every cycle.
 *
 * Every length is in `cqw` — a percentage of the container's width —
 * so the whole corridor keeps its proportions at any size. The
 * defaults were fitted numerically against a reference recording's
 * card-height and edge-position profile, not eyeballed.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/**
 * Geometry of the corridor. Every length is `cqw`, a percentage of the
 * container's width, so the shape is resolution-independent.
 *
 * These interact: the ribbon only stays solid while consecutive cards
 * overlap, which needs `exitHeight / birthHeight` spread over enough
 * `cards`. Raising `exitHeight`, dropping `cards`, or pulling `railExit`
 * in all push toward a visible tear near the frame edge.

Implementation Guidelines
 1. Analyze the component structure and identify all required dependencies
 2. Review the component's argumens and state
 3. Identify any required context providers or hooks and install them
 4. Questions to Ask
 - What data/props will be passed to this component?
 - Are there any specific state management requirements?
 - Are there any required assets (images, icons, etc.)?
 - What is the expected responsive behavior?
 - What is the best place to use this component in the app?

Steps to integrate
 0. Copy paste all the code above in the correct directories
 1. Install external dependencies
 2. Fill image assets with Unsplash stock images you know exist
 3. Use lucide-react icons for svgs or logos if component requires them
