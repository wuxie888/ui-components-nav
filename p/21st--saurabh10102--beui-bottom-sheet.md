You are given a task to integrate an existing React component in the codebase

The codebase should support:
- shadcn project structure
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript

If it doesn't, provide instructions on how to setup project via shadcn CLI, install Tailwind or Typescript.

Determine the default path for components and styles.
If default path for components is not /components/ui, provide instructions on why it's important to create this folder
Copy-paste this component to /components/ui folder:
```tsx

lib/touch.ts
// Shared touch primitives. iOS and iPadOS run their own gestures on top of the
// page — the long-press selection callout and the selection it drags in with
// it — and they win: once the platform claims a touch it cancels ours
// mid-gesture, so a press-and-hold or a drag simply dies. Surfaces that own
// their gesture have to opt out.
//
// What the two classes below cover, precisely:
// - `-webkit-touch-callout: none` stops iOS's long-press callout. WebKit-only:
//   it is not a property other engines have, so it is inert everywhere else.
// - `user-select: none` stops the long-press selection on every engine,
//   Android included, and stops a drag from painting a selection under the
//   cursor. It is inherited, so it reaches every descendant — which is why the
//   two classes differ only in whether they apply it unconditionally.
// What neither covers:
// - Chrome for Android's long-press menu on a link or an image. No CSS
//   suppresses it; a gesture surface that wraps one needs its own
//   `onContextMenu` with `preventDefault()`.
// - The native drag of an `<img>` or `<a>` descendant. `-webkit-user-drag` is
//   not inherited and plain divs and buttons are not drag sources, so setting
//   it on the surface does nothing — the child itself needs `draggable={false}`.

/**
 * Classes for a surface that *is* the control: a thumb, a drum, a stage, a
 * handle, a hold button. Selection is suppressed on every input, because a
 * drag that highlights the control's own label is wrong on a mouse too.
 * Compose with `touch-none` when the surface also owns the scroll axis — leave
 * it off when the page must still scroll from there.
 */

 * The same opt-out for a gesture surface that wraps content the consumer owns:
 * a scroller, a context-menu trigger, a sheet header, a list row. Selection is
 * suppressed only where the platform runs its own press gestures — a coarse
 * pointer — so a mouse user can still select and copy that content. If the
 * gesture itself would paint a selection under the cursor, add `select-none`
 * for the duration of the gesture rather than reaching for
 * `TOUCH_GESTURE_CLASS`.
 *
 * `pointer: coarse` describes the *primary* pointer and nothing else, so a
 * hybrid machine reads it wrong in both directions: a tablet with a mouse
 * plugged in keeps touch as primary and loses mouse selection, and a laptop
 * with a touchscreen keeps the mouse as primary and leaves selection live
 * under a finger. No media query can answer per interaction — the query is
 * about the device, and the question is about the gesture in progress. The
 * default stays here because it is right on the machines that are one thing or
 * the other, and losing a selection is a nuisance; where the miss costs a

Install NPM dependencies:
```bash
npm install clsx motion tailwind-merge
```

Implementation Guidelines
 1. Analyze the component structure and identify all required dependencies
 2. Review the component's argumens and state
 3. Identify any required context providers or hooks and install them
 4. Questions to Ask
 - What data/props will be passed to this component?
 - Are there any specific state management requirements?
 - Are there any required assets (images, icons, etc.)?
 - What is the expected responsive behavior?
 - What is the best place to use this component in the app?

Steps to integrate
 0. Copy paste all the code above in the correct directories
 1. Install external dependencies
 2. Fill image assets with Unsplash stock images you know exist
 3. Use lucide-react icons for svgs or logos if component requires them
